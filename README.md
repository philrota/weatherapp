### Weather app
This in one of my firsts applications. It can show you: your current timezone,temperature,summary about next days.
i have also added a converter to see the temperature also in celsius degrees.

## Why i built this app

this app was made for learning purposes,i'm learning react. This project allowed me to manipulate data via API with fetch()
and get it shown in the html.
So i learnt to:
-use fetch()
-retrieve data via API
-parse it into JSON
-render it on the document

## Is this already ready for deploy?
Actually no,i will keep it updated with new features and new styles.
